                <p class="serif">I can still vividly remember the exact location of my seat where I listened to the humming sound of public transit and the clinking sound of my computer; where I saw days and nights of city from the south window and dazzling sunlight coming from the east window; where I was tantalized by the delicious smell of dumplings for dinner; where I felt the wind brushing against my face. As I picture myself in the room, I feel familiar, inseparable and welcomed. I feel a sense of belonging. Knowing that I will always have a place in my room, I find courage and strength to survive in and adapt to a new environment and culture.

                <p class="sansserif">This course is designed to provide an overview of financial reporting. Financial reporting,
                        defined broadly, is the transmission of information from companies to external users.
                        "Companies" include small businesses, partnerships, corporations, and not-for-profits;
                        "users" include investors, creditors, analysts, auditors, the government, and more. The
                        overarching objective of A215 is to provide students with familiarity of financial accounting,
                        including the mechanics of accounting, how accounting information can be used in
                        decision making, and the role of accounting in business and more generally, in society as
                        a whole.</p>
